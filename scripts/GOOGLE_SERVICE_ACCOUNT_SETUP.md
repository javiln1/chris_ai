## Step 4: Download Credentials JSON (2 minutes)

1. **Find Your Service Account**
   - You should see your service account in the list
   - Email looks like: `chris-ai-docs-reader@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

2. **Create Key**
   - Click on the service account email
   - Go to the **KEYS** tab
   - Click **ADD KEY** â†’ **Create new key**

   - Move this file to your project folder:
     ```bash
     mv ~/Downloads/chris-ai-knowledge-base-*.json /Users/javilopez/cursor-projects/chris-ai/google-credentials.json
     ```

---

## Step 5: Share Google Drive Folder with Service Account (3 minutes)

**THIS IS THE KEY STEP - Don't skip this!**

Instead of sharing each doc individually, share the ENTIRE FOLDER:

1. **Find the Service Account Email**
   - From the credentials JSON file, copy the email
   - It looks like: `chris-ai-docs-reader@chris-ai-knowledge-base-xxxxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

2. **Share Your Google Drive Folder**
   - Go to Google Drive
   - Find the folder that contains ALL your transcript docs
   - **Right-click the folder** â†’ **Share**
   - Paste the service account email
   - Set permission to **Viewer**
   - **UNCHECK** "Notify people"
   - Click **Share**

3. **Done!**
   - Now the service account can read ALL docs in that folder
   - No need to share each doc individually!

---

## Step 6: Update Your .env File (1 minute)

Add this line to your `.env`:

```bash
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=./google-credentials.json
```

Your `.env` should now have:
```bash
PINECONE_API_KEY=pcsk_...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your-sheet-id
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=./google-credentials.json
```

---

## Step 7: Test It Works (1 minute)

Run the test script:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-doc-fetch-with-auth.ts
```

If you see:
```
âœ… SUCCESS! Fetched 8,432 characters
```

You're ready to upload!

---

## Step 8: Run Full Upload

```bash
./scripts/run-upload.sh
```

This will now:
1. Authenticate using the service account
2. Fetch ALL your private Google Docs
3. Upload full transcripts to Pinecone

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" error
- Make sure you shared the FOLDER (not individual docs)
- Service account email must match exactly
- Wait 1-2 minutes after sharing for permissions to propagate

### "File not found" error for credentials
- Make sure the file is named `google-credentials.json`
- Make sure it's in the project root folder
- Check the path in .env matches

### "API not enabled" error
- Go back to Step 2 and enable both APIs
- Make sure you're in the correct project

---

## Security Notes

- The `google-credentials.json` file is gitignored
- Never commit this file to GitHub
- Keep it safe - it has access to your docs
- You can revoke access anytime in Google Cloud Console

---
