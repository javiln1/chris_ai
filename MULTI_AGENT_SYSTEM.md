## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

### **Architecture:**
```
User Message → Agent Detection → API Route → Specialized AI → Response
     ↓              ↓              ↓           ↓            ↓
  "Write code" → Code Agent → /api/agents → GPT-4o-mini → Code Response
```

### **Key Components:**
- **`agents.ts`**: Agent definitions and routing logic
- **`/api/agents/route.ts`**: Multi-agent API endpoint
- **`agent-selector.tsx`**: Agent selection UI component
- **`multi-agent-chat.tsx`**: Main chat interface with agent integration

### **Smart Routing Algorithm:**
```typescript
// Keyword-based detection with fallback to General Agent
function detectAgentType(message: string): string {
  // Research keywords: 'research', 'find', 'what is', 'explain'
  // Code keywords: 'code', 'program', 'function', 'debug'
  // Creative keywords: 'creative', 'write', 'story', 'brainstorm'
  // Analysis keywords: 'analyze', 'data', 'pattern', 'trend'
  // Default: 'general'
}
```
