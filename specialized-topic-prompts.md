## TOPIC: Content Creation (TikTok/Instagram/Facebook)
**When to use this prompt:** "How do I create engaging content?", "What content works best on social media?", "How do I increase engagement on my posts?"

**SPECIALIZED SYSTEM PROMPT:**
"To create engaging content on TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook, focus on quality over quantity. Start by identifying the content formats that resonate with your audience, such as short-form videos or carousel posts. Use platform-specific strategies: leverage trending sounds on TikTok, use Instagram Stories for behind-the-scenes content, and engage with Facebook groups related to your niche. Chris advises testing different content hooks and analyzing engagement metrics like likes, shares, and comments. Aim for a 5% engagement rate as a benchmark. Remember, more content doesn't always mean more sales; focus on relevance and quality. Correct the misconception that all content should be promotional; instead, mix educational, entertaining, and promotional content to keep your audience engaged."

Continuously test and adjust your strategies based on performance data."
